                    <h5>The most fantastic things to do in Cuba in 2018: The Ultimate guide</h5>

                <p>There is such a wide range of things to do in Cuba, that it would be a pity to go for just a week.</p>

                <p>I love traveling to Latin America. I have a particular obsession for this amazing continent,
                    and Cuba has always ranked very high on my bucket list.
                    Although I have already been there, I would like to visit again, because there are many
                    incredible things to do in Cuba.</p>

                    <p>The soul of my city, my Skopje, is hidden among the monuments of the past and the present, among the stories of ancient rulers,
                        among recent and past revolutions, as well as in future transformations.
                        To capture that soul I have to stay away from all the commercial landmarks,
                        and connect my favorite experiences with those places I hold closest to my heart.</p>
