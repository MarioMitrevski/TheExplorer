            <h4>My Skopje, My City, My Story</h4>
            <p>The soul of my city, my Skopje, is hidden among the monuments of the past and the present,
                among the stories of ancient rulers, among recent and past revolutions, as well as in future transformations.
                To capture that soul I have to stay away from all the commercial landmarks,
                and connect my favorite experiences with those places I hold closest to my heart.</p>

            <h3><strong>First experience</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p>The smell of chestnuts on the streets in winter.
                People pick chestnuts from the nearby mountains like Vodno, and bring bags of them back to the city.
                There are dozens of street vendors with chestnut roasting stands around the main square and close to the old mall,
                all selling deliciously roasted chestnuts during the winter months.
                When you detect the smell of chestnuts in the air, you know the winter is here.</p>

                <h3><strong>Second experience</strong></h3>
                <br>

                <p>Visiting the old shopping mall in the center of the city.
                    It was the first one in the Balkans, built right after the earthquake in 1963.
                    &nbsp; Although in the past few years it has been neglected due to the opening of a great number of new,
                    more sophisticated malls, it still holds a special magic, with reflections, mystic passages,
                    shadows and some old stores reminiscent of times past.
                    &nbsp;A few years back when it was meant to be given a new baroque look, the citizens of Skopje stood up and
                    &lsquo;defended&rsquo; the mall by making a circle around the building, as a symbol of a big hug.
                    It can be an interesting journey through time during morning walks through the city.</p>

            <h3><strong>Third experience</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p>The misty reflections in the new part of town.
                The modern quarter, located in the heart of the city, combines glass and straight lines,
                which makes for some stunning reflections on a windy spring day.
                It is the only part of the new city centre that I actually like. Among the busy municipal buildings,
                numerous fancy restaurants and stores, you will find the reflections of the clouds, birds and sun. A beautiful urban jungle.</p>

                <h3><strong>Fourth experience</strong></h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Contemporary Art Museum, the artistic soul of Skopje.
                    It is on top of the Kale hill rising elegantly between the old and the new part of Skopje.
                    This modern architecture building has many contemporary art pieces from both Macedonian and foreign authors placed in the most magical
                    space enclosed in glass with a view of the city from all points.
                    The play of light, reflections and beauty are magical in all seasons and at any time of the day.</p>

            <h3><strong>Fifth experience</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p>&nbsp; the oldest glow in town. Walk through the old Bazaar streets in the afternoon sun.
                You will meet all the cultures that inhabit Skopje, all its religions and nationalities, living, eating and loving each other in one place.
                Loving the city, loving its traditions. There are crafts in all colors, old hamams turned into art galleries...
                kebab, tea and sweets with traditional tastes in restaurants dating from way back.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The amazing Skopje sunsets. Behind the distant and yet not so far Shar mountain.
                    I choose to sit at Kale fortress and see the sun melting above the city.
                    In winter you can indulge in a walk in the snow by the glowing river in the late afternoon golden hour.</p>

            <h3><strong>Seventh experience</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Climbing the highest spot. Skopje is surrounded by mountains,
                but Vodno is the only one that practically rises straight up from the center of the city.
                And it&#39;s accessible to everyone. Either walk or take the car halfway up the mountain, and then a cable car to the top.
                You will enjoy all seasons up there; lower temperatures in summer,
                when you can enjoy tea and coffee on the terrace of an old mountain hut with a view of the city,
                or when the ice forms in winter on the trails around the Millennium Cross monument.
                From here, you can literally watch the city breathing&hellip;</p>
