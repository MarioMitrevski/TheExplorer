        <h3><strong>1.) Christ the Redeemer</strong></h3>
            <br>
        <p>Probably the most iconic statue in the world, Christ the Redeemer stands at 98 feet (30 m) tall, looming over the city of Rio at a staggering total height of 2,300 feet (701 m). Talk about a view, right???</p>
        <p>Located on the summit of Mount Corcovado, the statue is the result of the combined efforts of three individuals: French sculptor Paul Landowski, Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, and French engineer Albert Caquot &#8211; kinda in keeping with Rio&#8217;s diverse people and cultures.</p>
        <p>The statue is accessible by a train that leaves every 30 minutes, from 8:30am to 7:00pm. For the best views, sit on the right side of the train as it makes its way up the mountain. Admission costs 36 Brazilian Real (R$) and the site is open daily.</p>

                <h3><strong>2.) Sugarloaf Mountain</strong></h3>
                <br>
                <p>The 1,300 foot (396 m) tall Sugarloaf Mountain is a rather popular sight to visit in Rio&#8230;and one that (understandably) always makes me think food! A two-part cable car trip to the top offers 360 degree views of the city, as well as the surrounding ocean and lush green forests.</p>
                <p>Several fast-food restaurants are located on the top of the mountain,so you can grab a bite to eat up there while taking in the gorgeous views. If youâ€™d rather walk, there is a trail that wraps around the mountain.</p>

        <h3><strong>3.) Copacabana Beach</strong></h3>
            <br>
        <p>Even the name of the beach alone conjures up images of partying, dancing and cocktails! ðŸ™‚ Copacabana Beach is without a doubt one of the most iconic beaches in the world.</p>
        <p>Located in the Zona Sul area of Rio, the beach has stunning views of both Sugarloaf Mountain and Copacabana Fort. Beach-goers here can either just chill and soak up those rays, or spend their time enjoying doing one of the many sports located right on the beach (e.g. volleyball)&#8230; you&#8217;ll probably find me doing the former &#8211; cocktail in hand!</p>

                <br>
                <p>While being in Rio for its famous Carnival would be AMAZING, Samba-season fun can be had year round with a Samba City Tour! The tour has visitors explore the venue where the floats for Carnival are prepared, as well as where the dancers can practice their Samba routines.</p>
                <p>Visitors will also get to experience a musical performance, and then be able to try playing instruments used during Carnival.

        <h3><strong>5.) Santa Teresa</strong></h3>
            <br>
        <p>For a real treat, wander the picturesque streets of Santa Teresa &#8211; one of the prettiest neighbourhoods in Rio. The colourful streets are full of charm, and are famed for being particularly artsy.</p>
        <p>Be sure to see the Escadaria Selaron, an ongoing staircase art project that uses ceramics, tiles, and mirror pieces from around the world. The Convent is also a top sight in the neighbourhood, as well as the only working streetcar remaining in the city, known as the Bonde de Santa Teresa. Only five minutes from downtown Rio, Santa Teresa has also has lots of food options, live music, and a lively night-scene (so you know where to find me when I&#8217;m in Rio ðŸ˜‰ ).</p>

                <br>
                <p>Tijuca Forest is to Rio what Central Park is to New York&#8230; except, Tijuca is a tropical rainforest!

        <h3><strong>7.) Feira Hippie de Ipanema</strong></h3>
            <br>
        <p>The â€˜Hippie Market of Ipanemaâ€™ is the perhaps the best place in Rio to find authentic souvenirs!</p>
        <p>What started as a fairly small market (formed by hippies) in 1968 has grown into a 700 stall mini-city. Folk and contemporary art, jewellery, clothing, and crafts can all be bought here, as well as some really delicious food. *licks lips* This is also a great place to practise your haggling skills while trying to get the best deal possible for your sovenirs! While youâ€™re in the neighbourhood, be sure to stop by the famous Ipanema Beach.</p>
        <p>The Hippie Market is open every Sunday from 9:00am to 5:00pm.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Thanks to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, this stadium in Rio has become well known to people all over the world. Built in 1950, the stadium has 78,000 seats, and is a popular venue for lots of sporting events. For the best experience, visit the stadium during a game, when the place comes alive with the energy of the fans.</p>
                <p>If you canâ€™t make it for a game, one-hour long tours are also available, ranging in price from R$36 to R$76 depending on which sort of tour package you want.</p>

                <p>For amazing art, check out the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, or maybe the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
                <p>For a look into the fascinating history of Brazil, head to the National Historical Museum or the National Museum of Brazil.</p>
                <p>For a really beautiful experience, try the Imperial Museum of Brazil, which used to be the summer palace of Emperor Pedro II.</p>
