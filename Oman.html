    <h4>Oman</h4>
    <div class="grid-Oman">


    <p><strong>So, I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of top ten lists but I&#8217;m guessing Oman isn&#8217;t completely
        saturated with them yet or in fact, Oman travel videos by the looks of it. </strong>I&#8217;ll keep my stories
        of goat attacks, burst tyres, random party invites, accidentally breaking into airports and exploding gas
        canisters for next time&#8230;</p>
    <p>If anyone is wondering why <strong>Oman is on the Lonely Planet <a
            href="http://www.danflyingsolo.com/go/lonelyplanet/" target="_blank">Best
        in Travel list</a> for 2017</strong> I&#8217;m hoping this Oman Tavel Video will answer that question. If not,
        the ten reasons to visit Oman below should be enough to have you booking a ticket.</p>

    <h3>Oman Travel Video, The Three Minute Guide&#8230;</h3>

    <video src="images/Oman%20Travel%20Video%20Guide%20-%20Things%20to%20See%20in%20Oman.mp4 " controls></video>

    <h3>1. Lonely Planet said go</h3>
    <p>Every year Lonely Planet release their<strong> <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel">Best in
        Travel</a> </strong>list of destinations, regions and experiences that are going to be the travel trends of the
        year ahead and Oman came at number eight on their top countries to visit.</p>
    <p>I headed there to Snapchat this beautiful country for them last week and from the comments, I can tell you one
        thing &#8211; Oman is quickly going to the top of everyone&#8217;s list so <strong>get in now before the crowds
            descend. </strong></p>

    <h3>2. Hospitality knows no bounds</h3>
    <p>The video of Oman above might not depict it, <strong>but the hospitality I experienced in Oman was unlike
        anywhere else.</strong></p>
    <p>From the Bedouin (nomadic) ladies that live in the desert stopping to offer us tea through to the full blown
        picnic we were invited to join on top of a mountain, I have never felt more welcome anywhere. How people can
        write all the Middle East off as a dangerous place to travel baffles me. <strong>Oman is safe.</strong> I slept
        in a tent every night and had zero concerns for my safety (other than hungry goats).</p>

    <h3>3. 4WD For the Win</h3>
    <p>Whilst I have read some accounts of people travelling Oman with a 2WD and saying it was no problem, the roads we
        went down were certainly not doable without a 4WD and even then we managed to blow a tyre <em>(easily
            replaceable in many shops).</em></p>
    <p><strong>Given the remoteness of some places, I opted to hire from a local company</strong> with offices on the
        ground in case of any emergencies for my <a href="http://www.marktoursoman.com/">Oman 4WD hire</a>. Mark Tours
        as well as running their regular tours throughout the country have a range of vehicles and they can be picked up
        from Ruwi (Muscat) or the airport and can be <a href="http://www.marktoursoman.com/">booked online</a>. Sadly, I
        don&#8217;t have a license but <strong>smashing through sand dunes looked like an awesome experience to be
            behind the wheel for.</strong></p>
    <h3>4. Wildlife of all kinds</h3>
    <p>I can&#8217;t think of many countries where <strong>for sunrise you can be on a beach watching huge turtles
        laying eggs and then by sunset be in the middle of a desert as wild camels stroll past.</strong> Donkeys,
        camels, snakes, leopards, turtles and my beloved goats that star in the Oman travel video litter the landscape
        of this country making it ideal for animal lovers.</p>

    <h3>5. The silence of the desert</h3>
    <p><strong>The Wahiba Sands are a stunning backdrop</strong> and as my first desert experience surpassed all my
        &#8216;Arabian nights&#8217; expectations. The Travel video of Oman above only shows a small snippet of how
        impressive they are and sadly, Drones are not legally allowed in the country so I couldn&#8217;t capture the
        sheer size of it. But trust me, it needs to get on any list you have!</p>
    <h3>6. Postcard perfect Wadis</h3>
    <p>The <strong>two wadis in the Oman video I shot are Wadi Bani Khalid and Wadi Shab.</strong> These beautiful
        canyons can be found both inland and coming in from the coast and provide a tropical paradise to cool down from
        the Oman heat.</p>
    <p>Although these two might be the most famous near Muscat you will stumble on them in varying sizes through the
        country. Being able to take your Oman 4WD and drive through the dried up (and sometimes shallow) Wadis is an
        awesome experience.</p>

    <h3>7. Those Oman beaches though</h3>
    <p>Oman hugs both the Gulf of Oman, with Iran and Pakistan across the <a
            href="http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/hormuz-irans-multicoloured-island/">Hormuz Straight</a> and the
        Arabian sea along the east coast. The rocky coastline, miles of sandy beaches and the crystal clear water make
        this also an ideal chill or scuba destination as well as one for adventure.</p>
    <p>Although I didn&#8217;t get much time to explore the coast and as such is it missing from the Oman video I shot,
        I plan to head back and visit the <a
                href="http://www.omantourism.gov.om/wps/portal/mot/tourism/oman/home/sultanate/regions/musandam/">Musandam
            peninsula</a> early next year. <strong>Often referred to as the &#8216;Fjords of Oman&#8217; due to its
            similarity to Norway make sure you give yourself time to visit </strong>as it is disconnected from the
        mainland by the UAE.</p>
    <h3>8. The Grand Canyon of Arabia</h3>
    <p>Jebel Shams, a mountain region a few hours drive from Muscat is home to the <strong>highest point in eastern
        Arabia.</strong> A huge Wadi runs along nearby and is often referred to as the Grand Canyon of Arabia due to the
        sheer drop and impressive limestone rock canyon. If I wasn&#8217;t such a wuss when it comes to heights I might
        have got a bit more of it in the travel video of Oman I made, but alas &#8211; since slipping off an icy
        mountain in Switzerland and a bunch of Japanese tourist found it better to laugh and take photos of me as I
        clung on than help I&#8217;ve become a bit anxious around heights&#8230;</p>

    <h3>9. Camping under the stars in Oman</h3>
    <p><strong>Oman is a popular wild camping destination,</strong> not just for tourists but also for the locals
        &#8211; heading into the mountains on the weekend to enjoy the nature of their country.</p>
    <p>Whether you are in the middle of the Wahiba sands or atop of the mountain region, the silence and lack of light
        are deafening. Literally, bar the odd goat <em>(and their freaky ass eyes when a torch hits them)</em><strong>
            you could hear a pin drop as you marvel at the incredible milky way above.</strong></p>
    <h3>10. Oman is not that expensive</h3>
    <p>Sure,<strong> if you come to Oman and go to the luxury resorts and head out on tours you will drop a lot of
        money.</strong> But I reckon I spent around $25 a day on average and for one of the best trips of my life, I
        thought the country was insanely good value.</p>
    <p>Though, if you don&#8217;t mind sitting in goat poop now and then <em>(yep, they aren&#8217;t pebbles)</em> or a
        lack of showers you might want to follow my steps to exploring this country on the wild side. <strong>More to
            follow on budgets and itineraries soon!</strong></p>
